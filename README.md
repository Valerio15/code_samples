# Celeste/Animal Crossing-Style Dialogue System Integration

This Unity project integrates a Celeste/Animal Crossing-style dialogue system that manipulates the pitch and audio of dialogue lines, ensuring consistency when replaying the same sentence. This system is integrated with Pixel Crusher's Dialogue System, a widely used package for managing dialogues in Unity.

## Overview

The dialogue system consists of several scripts:
1. **CustomTypewriterEffect**: Customizes the typewriter effect for dialogues.
2. **ManageAudioPitch**: Manages the pitch and audio playback using hash codes for consistency.

### Integration with Pixel Crusher's Dialogue System

Pixel Crusher's Dialogue System is a powerful and flexible dialogue system for Unity. My integration ensures that the audio pitch and playback are consistent for the same dialogue lines, creating a more immersive and cohesive experience.

## Script Analysis

### 1. CustomTypewriterEffect.cs
**Purpose**: Customizes the typewriter effect to work with the dialogue system, ensuring that each character's audio is played with the correct pitch.

### 2. ManageAudioPitch.cs
**Purpose**: Manages the pitch and audio playback for each character in the dialogue, using hash codes to ensure consistency.

## How It Works

### Pitch and Audio Consistency

To achieve consistent audio playback for the same dialogue lines, we use hash codes. Each sentence is hashed, and the hash code is used to determine the pitch and audio playback. This ensures that the same sentence will always be played with the same pitch and audio, even if it is replayed multiple times.

### CustomTypewriterEffect.cs

This script customizes the typewriter effect in the dialogue system. It ensures that each character's audio is played with the correct pitch by using the `ManageAudioPitch` script.

### ManageAudioPitch.cs

This script handles the pitch manipulation and audio playback. It uses hash codes to determine the pitch for each character in the dialogue. When a sentence is replayed, the same hash code is used, ensuring consistent audio playback.

## Integration Steps

1. **Setup Pixel Crusher's Dialogue System**: Ensure that the Dialogue System package is imported and set up in your Unity project.

2. **Implement CustomTypewriterEffect**: Create a custom typewriter effect script that integrates with the Dialogue System and uses the `ManageAudioPitch` script to play audio for each character with the correct pitch.

3. **Implement ManageAudioPitch**: Create a script that manages the pitch and audio playback using hash codes for consistency.

4. **Attach Scripts to Dialogue Components**: Attach the `CustomTypewriterEffect` and `ManageAudioPitch` scripts to the appropriate dialogue components in your Unity project.

5. **Configure Dialogue Lines**: Ensure that each dialogue line is processed by the `CustomTypewriterEffect` script, and the audio is managed by the `ManageAudioPitch` script.

## Conclusion

This integration provides a consistent and immersive dialogue experience by manipulating pitch and audio playback using hash codes. By leveraging Pixel Crusher's Dialogue System, we ensure that the dialogue management is robust and flexible, allowing for seamless integration and customization in Unity.

# Unity Movement System

This Unity project includes two different types of player movement systems, each with its unique implementation approach. Additionally, the project includes a `GroundCheck` script that is used within the `PlayerMovement` script to determine if the player is grounded.

## Overview

The movement system consists of the following scripts:
1. **SmoothPlayerMovement**: Implements a smooth movement system.
2. **PlayerMovement**: Implements a more traditional movement system with ground checking.
3. **GroundCheck**: Checks if the player is grounded.

## Script Analysis

### 1. SmoothPlayerMovement.cs
**Purpose**: Implements a smooth and fluid movement system for the player.

**Key Features**:
- Smooth transitions and accelerations.
- Responsive controls with easing functions.

### 2. PlayerMovement.cs
**Purpose**: Implements a traditional movement system with explicit ground checking.

**Key Features**:
- Uses the `GroundCheck` script to determine if the player is on the ground.
- Implements jumping, running, and other standard movements.
- Handles player input for movement and actions.

### 3. GroundCheck.cs
**Purpose**: Determines if the player is grounded.

**Key Features**:
- Uses raycasting or collider checks to detect ground.
- Provides a boolean flag to other scripts indicating whether the player is grounded.

## How They Work

### SmoothPlayerMovement.cs

The `SmoothPlayerMovement` script focuses on providing a smooth and fluid movement experience. It typically involves:

- **Smooth Transitions**: Implementing easing functions to smooth out acceleration and deceleration.
- **Fluid Controls**: Making the player's movement feel responsive and natural by fine-tuning the input handling and movement physics.

This type of movement system is often used in games where a polished and refined control scheme is crucial, such as platformers or action-adventure games.

### PlayerMovement.cs

The `PlayerMovement` script uses a more traditional approach to movement, incorporating ground checking to handle jumping and grounded states. It involves:

- **Ground Checking**: Using the `GroundCheck` script to determine if the player is on the ground before allowing jumps or other ground-specific actions.
- **Standard Movement**: Implementing basic movement mechanics like running, jumping, and crouching.
- **Input Handling**: Processing player inputs to move the character and perform actions.

This approach is commonly used in a variety of game genres where straightforward and reliable movement mechanics are required.

### GroundCheck.cs

The `GroundCheck` script is a utility script used by `PlayerMovement` to determine if the player is grounded. It typically works by:

- **Raycasting**: Casting a ray downward from the player's position to check for collisions with the ground.
- **Collider Checks**: Using colliders to detect when the player is touching the ground.
- **Boolean Flag**: Providing a boolean value that other scripts can check to see if the player is grounded.

## Implementation Differences

- **Movement Style**: `SmoothPlayerMovement` focuses on smooth and fluid movement, while `PlayerMovement` provides traditional movement mechanics.
- **Ground Checking**: `PlayerMovement` relies on the `GroundCheck` script to determine if the player can jump or perform other ground-based actions. `SmoothPlayerMovement` may implement its own version of ground checking or handle it differently.
- **Complexity**: `SmoothPlayerMovement` is likely more complex due to the need for smooth transitions and easing functions, while `PlayerMovement` focuses on straightforward movement logic.

## Conclusion

Both movement systems offer different approaches to player control, catering to different types of games and player experiences. The `GroundCheck` script is a crucial component for ensuring that the `PlayerMovement` script functions correctly by accurately determining when the player is grounded.
